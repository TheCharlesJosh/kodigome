  <Summary>Is this a survey? Will my votes get tallied?</Summary>
  <Panel>
    No, this is not a survey. Intentionally, there is no way kodigo.me can
    collect or tally votes or any personal information from its users.

  <Summary>Where did the list of candidates comes from?</Summary>
  <Panel>
    COMELEC routinely releases their ballot templates in their website. kodigo.me presents the names of all candidates, their positions, and their political affiliations as is on the ballot template.

    *  [2025 Ballot Templates](https://comelec.gov.ph/?r=2025NLE/BallotFaceTemplates), released last January 2025
    *  [2022 Ballot Templates](https://comelec.gov.ph/?r=2022NLE/BallotFaceTemplates), released last January 2022

  <Summary>What do I need to know during Election Day?</Summary>
  <Panel>
    
    Before Election Day, make sure to know your precinct number and location.
    COMELEC released a [precinct finder tool](https://precinctfinder.comelec.gov.ph/voter_precinct) last 2023 but it seems to be offline. 
    
    During Election Day, you may refer to the official 2022 guide from COMELEC
    [here](https://comelec.gov.ph/?r=2022NLE/VoterEducation/StepsinVoting).
    Voting time starts at 6:00 AM and ends at 7:00 PM.

  <Summary>Why did you create this?</Summary>
  <Panel>
    
    Before the 2022 National and Local Elections, I used to come to the voting precinct only knowing a handful of people I wanted to vote for. Knowing that COMELEC makes the ballot templates available online, as well as numerous sites like [GMA](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/eleksyon2022/mykodigo/) releasing their own kodigo generator, I thought that there should be a better way to be prepared before Election Day.

    After a series of usability tests, the benefits can be summarized to the following:

    1. I want to see who's running for what position so that I can do some research on who they are beyond name-recall and campaigns.
    2. I want to create a kodigo easily so that it's easier to vote on Election Day.
    3. As it were in 2022, I want to finish voting quickly by making sure I know already who I'm voting for, given that the threat of the pandemic was still present at that time.

  <Summary>Why are the headers colored blue and green?</Summary>
  <Panel>
    
    As much as possible, I wanted to make kodigo.me look like (but not too similar to) the actual ballot so that it's easier to remember where to shade. Having said that, the ballot's headers are also colored blue and green.

    kodigo.me will never endorse any political candidate or party.

  <Summary>Can I create a ballot even if I leave some positions empty?</Summary>
  <Panel>
    
    Yes! Much like you can abstain or [undervote](https://ballotpedia.org/Undervote) in the elections, you can also leave parts of your kodigo blank. This will also allow you to revise your kodigo sometime after.

  <Summary>What's the QR Code for? What's the kodigo.me link for?</Summary>
  <Panel>
    
    It points to a link where you can see your generated kodigo, and have the option to edit it again. This link tells kodigo.me the candidates selected, and so if you modify your kodigo, you have to save again and create a new link.

  <Summary>I have some feedback/I want to reach out. How can I contact the owner of the site?</Summary>
  <Panel>
    
    You may send me a message at kodigo.me's [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/kodigomeph/), or email me [here](mailto:hello@charlesjosh.com).
