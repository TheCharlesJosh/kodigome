## Notes

- **January 15, 2025** - COMELEC retracts upload of ballot face templates due to TROs released last January 14, 2025 ([Re: COMELEC Commits to Fully Comply with Supreme Court TROs in relation to the 2025 elections](https://comelec.gov.ph/?r=2025NLE/PressReleases/01142025_SC_TRO_COMELEC)). This meant that the ballot face templates we downloaded are to be updated at a later date.

- **January 26, 2025** - COMELEC reuploads new ballot face templates in compliance with the TROs.
